// 1. HTML5 Web Storage

// Web Storage is a new HTML5 API that allows applications to store data on the client side, rather than in traditional cookies, which can be more secure and can hold larger amounts of data. Web Storage consists of two objects, sessionStorage and localStorage, which allow data to be stored for a session or indefinitely, respectively. Unlike cookies, Web Storage data is not automatically sent to the server with every request, and can be accessed and modified using JavaScript. Data stored in Web Storage is specific to the page protocol and is always stored as strings.

// 1.1. sessionStorage

// SessionStorage is a type of Web Storage that allows you to store data only within a particular tab or window of a web browser. It is meant to store data for a single session or visit to a website, and the data will be removed when the tab or window is closed. While it has similar functions to LocalStorage, which can store data even after the tab or window is closed, we will only discuss LocalStorage for now.

// 1.2. localStorage

// HTML5 localStorage is a way to store data in a user's web browser that doesn't expire. This data remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened, as well as between tabs and windows. However, this data is only available within a single browser and cannot be accessed by other browsers. There are five methods to work on local storage: setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), clear(), and key().

// 1.3. Use case of Web Storages

// Web Storage, including sessionStorage and localStorage, can be used in various scenarios, such as storing data temporarily or saving products in a shopping cart. Web Storage can also make data available between page requests, multiple browser tabs, and even between browser sessions using localStorage. It can be used offline completely with localStorage and can even store images in strings using Base64 encoding.

// Web Storage can also be used for user authentication methods. In general, it makes sense to use localStorage for most cases, but sessionStorage can be useful when we want to get rid of data as soon as the window is closed or we don't want the application to interfere with the same application open in another window.

// So, to summarize, Web Storage can be used in various ways to store and retrieve data in the browser, and its sessionStorage and localStorage can serve different use cases based on the requirement of data storage.
