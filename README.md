## Days

- `Day 01 Introduction`: This challenge provides an introduction to the course and covers basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, and data types.
- `Day 02 Data Types`: This challenge covers data types in JavaScript, including primitive data types, and non-primitive data types.
- `Day 03 Booleans, Operators, and Dates`: This challenge covers booleans and operators in JavaScript, as well as working with dates.
- `Day 04 Conditionals`: This challenge covers conditional statements in JavaScript, including if-else statements, switch statements, and ternary operators.
- `Day 05 Arrays`: This challenge covers arrays in JavaScript, including array methods, iteration, and manipulation.
- `Day 06 Loops`: This challenge covers loops in JavaScript, including for loops, while loops, do-while loops, break, and continue statements.
- `Day 07 Functions`: This challenge covers various aspects of functions, including function declaration, function expression, arrow functions, and self-invoking functions. It also covers different types of parameters in functions, including unlimited parameters in regular and arrow functions, default parameters, and anonymous functions.
- `Day 08 Objects`: This challenge covers scope and objects in JavaScript, including window global object, global scope, and local scope, creating an empty object, creating an objecting with values, getting values from an object, creating object methods, setting new key for an object, and object methods
- `Day 09 Higher Order Functions`: This challenge covers the concept of higher-order functions, callbacks, returning functions, setting time using setInterval and setTimeout functions, and functional programming methods such as forEach, map, filter, reduce, every, find, findIndex, some, and sort for string, numeric values, and object arrays.
- `Day 10 Sets and Maps`: This challenge covers sets and maps, including creating an empty set, creating a set from an array, adding and deleting an element to a set, checking an element in the set, clearing the set, union, intersection, and difference of sets. It also covers creating an empty map, creating a map from an array, adding and getting values from map, and checking keys in map.
- `Day 11 Destructuring and Spreading`: This challenge covers advanced JavaScript concepts including destructuring arrays and objects, renaming during destructuring, using destructuring during iteration, utilizing the spread or rest operator to copy arrays and objects, and using the spread operator with arrow functions for concise coding.
- `Day 12 Regular Expressions`: This challenge covers creating and working with regular expressions in JavaScript, including creating patterns with RegExp Constructor or without, RegExp parameters such as flags and patterns, using square brackets and escape characters, and working with quantifiers and the caret symbol. It also covers RegExp object methods for testing, matching, and replacing strings.
- `Day 13 Console Object Methods`: This challenge covers the console object methods in JavaScript, such as logging messages with console.log(), displaying tables with console.table(), measuring code performance with console.time(), and more.
- `Day 14 Error Handling`: This challenge covers error handling in JavaScript, including error types and handling, try-catch block, and throwing and catching errors.
- `Day 15 Classes`: This challenge covers creating and instantiating classes in JavaScript, defining constructors, methods, properties with initial values, and using getter, setter, and static methods. It also explores inheritance, including overriding methods.

## Installation

1. To run the projects in this repository, you'll need to have a text editor and a web browser installed on your local machine.

2. Install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
  
   - To install Visual Studio Code, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).


## Usage

1. To use the projects in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/aamirxshaikh/30-days-of-js`

2. After you've cloned the repository to your local machine, you can either open the project directory in your preferred IDE or use a text editor to edit the code.

3. Each day's project is contained in a separate folder, so to run a particular day's project, navigate to that day's folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. In addition to the browser, you can also use the Quokka extension to quickly run and debug JavaScript code directly in the editor. With Quokka, you can see the output of your code in real-time and easily experiment with different inputs and outputs.
