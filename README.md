## Installation

1. To run the projects in this repository, you'll need to have a text editor and a web browser installed on your local machine.

2. Install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
  
   - To install Visual Studio Code, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).


## Usage

1. To use the projects in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/aamirxshaikh/30-days-of-js`

2. After you've cloned the repository to your local machine, you can either open the project directory in your preferred IDE or use a text editor to edit the code.

3. Each day's project is contained in a separate folder, so to run a particular day's project, navigate to that day's folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. In addition to the browser, you can also use the Quokka extension to quickly run and debug JavaScript code directly in the editor. With Quokka, you can see the output of your code in real-time and easily experiment with different inputs and outputs.
